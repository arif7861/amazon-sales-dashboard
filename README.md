# Amazon Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

This repository contains my first sales dashboard built using **Power BI Desktop**.

## What's inside
- `Amazone Sales Dashboard.pbix` – the Power BI report file.

## Open the report
1. Install **Power BI Desktop** (Windows).
2. Download this repository (Code ▸ Download ZIP) or `git clone` it.
3. Open `Amazone Sales Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.

> Tip: If your PBIX has data sources with local paths or credentials, update them via **Transform data ▸ Data source settings**.
